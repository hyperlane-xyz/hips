# HIP
Repository for managing Hyperlane Improvement Proposals

#### Background
The Hyperlane Improvement Proposal is a tool for thinking through enhancements to the protocol and documenting findings for team review. The goal of HIP is to do meaningful exploration into R&D so that the future of Hyperlane reflects our best thinking.

#### What is a HIP?

Borrowing language from [EIP](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1#what-is-an-eip), *HIP stands for Hyperlane Improvement Proposal. A HIP is a design document providing information to the Hyperlane community, or describing a new feature for Hyperlane or its processes or environment. The HIP should provide a concise technical specification of the feature and a rationale for the feature. The HIP author is responsible for building consensus within the community and documenting dissenting opinions.*
